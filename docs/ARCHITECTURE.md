# Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture and data flow of the AI agent built using MindsDB.

## System Components

The AI agent system comprises the following main components:

1.  **MindsDB Core**: The central open-source AI layer that acts as an intermediary between your data sources, AI models, and the AI agent.
2.  **AI Model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4)**: An external Large Language Model integrated with MindsDB to provide natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning capabilities.
3.  **Data Sources**:
    * **Web Crawler**: MindsDB's built-in web crawling engine to ingest unstructured data from websites.
    * **Structured Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)**: An external relational database holding structured data.
4.  **MindsDB Tools**: Mechanisms within MindsDB that allow the AI agent to interact with specific data sources or perform operations. In this project, these include:
    * **Web Knowledge Base**: A vectorized representation of the web-crawled data, optimized for semantic search.
    * **Structured Data View**: A view over the PostgreSQL data, potentially enriched with LLM-generated insights.
5.  **AI Agent**: The MindsDB AI agent itself, which orchestrates queries, selects appropriate tools, and generates responses.
6.  **Client Application (Python Script)**: A simple Python script demonstrating how to programmatically interact with the MindsDB agent.

## Data Flow

The typical data flow when a user queries the AI agent is as follows:

1.  **User Query**: A user submits a natural language question (e.g., "What is MindsDB and what are the common issues in our database?") via the Python script or MindsDB GUI.
2.  **Query to MindsDB Agent**: The query is sent to the `my_ai_agent` defined in MindsDB.
3.  **Agent Orchestration**:
    * The AI agent, powered by the configured LLM (`my_gpt_model`), analyzes the user's question.
    * Based on the question's intent and content, the agent determines which `tools` (e.g., `web_knowledge_base`, `my_structured_data_view`) are most relevant to answer the query.
    * It formulates sub-queries or requests to these tools.
4.  **Tool Execution**:
    * If the question relates to web content, the agent queries the `web_knowledge_base`, which performs a semantic search on the vectorized web data.
    * If the question relates to structured data, the agent queries the `my_structured_data_view`, which accesses the underlying PostgreSQL database. If enrichment was configured, the LLM might perform additional processing (e.g., suggesting fixes).
5.  **Data Retrieval**: The relevant data or insights are retrieved from the respective data sources via their MindsDB tools.
6.  **Response Synthesis**: The AI agent receives the results from the tools. The LLM then synthesizes these results into a coherent, natural language response.
7.  **Response to User**: The synthesized response is returned to the user via the client application.
