This project demonstrates how to build a powerful AI agent using **MindsDB** to query both web-crawled data and structured database information. The agent unifies disparate data sources to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries, simplifying data access and insights.

## üöÄ Features

* **Unified Data Access**: Query web content and structured databases with a single AI agent.
* **Intelligent Responses**: Leverage LLMs for context-aware answers and data enrichment.
* **Easy Setup**: Utilize MindsDB's SQL-like interface for agent creation and data integration.
* **Programmatic Interaction**: Interact with the agent using a simple Python SDK.

## ‚ú® Why This Project?

In today's data-rich environment, information is often scattered across various sources. This project tackles the challenge of unifying disparate data (e.g., website documentation, internal issue trackers) into a single, queryable AI agent. It showcases MindsDB's capabilities in:
* Rapidly building AI agents without extensive custom code.
* Integrating diverse data types (unstructured web data, structured database records).
* Enriching existing data with LLM-generated insights.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Get the AI agent up and running in a few simple steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. You'll also need an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or for your chosen LLM provider).
2.  **Run MindsDB**:
    ```bash
    docker pull mindsdb/mindsdb
    docker run -p 47334:47334 -p 47335:47335 mindsdb/mindsdb
    ```
3.  **Mindsdb**: Follow [Reference1](Reference1.md) and [Reference2](Reference2.md)

For detailed setup instructions, including database connection specifics and API key management, please refer to the [INSTALLATION Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).
